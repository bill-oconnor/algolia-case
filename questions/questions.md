Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

Hi Marissa,

I am sorry to hear that you are having trouble using the dashboard, we certainly don't want clearing and deleting indexes to be inconvenient. The future quality of our product depends on feedback like yours, so thank you for reaching out. I will pass the feedback along to our product team. In the meantime, let's set up a call and see if we can't help you complete your task more efficiently. When are you available in the next few days?

Cheers,
Will

I am assuming that, with the help of a TAM, Marissa could develop a more streamlined approach, likely with an API- as opposed to GUI-based approach. Likewise, I am assuming that setting up a call like this is standard operating protocol. Lastly, I am assuming that Marissa is a paying customer

*Question 2*:   
  
From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

Hi Carrie,

It sounds like the record may become too large if you are storing a lot of metadata that is not for search in the Algolia search index. Your team will want to use the search index primarily for searchable content. Here is a guide for more detail:

Let me know if you need help reworking the code in this fashion, I'd be happy to help.

Cheers,
Will

Can you fix it please?  

*Answer 3*
Hi Marc,

I'm happy to try to help you get going. First, I'd like to know a bit more about your use case. Have you gotten Algolia integrated in your website? At what point are you seeing this error? Any additional context you can provide is helpful. If you haven't already, see if our Getting Started guide can help you out, and let me know if you are still having any issues.

Thanks,

*Answer 3 commentary/assumptions*
It looks like Searchkit is a competitor Search UI for usage with Elastic. I would need to verify that Marc is a customer (it seems like that's a no), but for this question, I am going to assume that he is a paying customer who is having a ton of trouble getting set up.
